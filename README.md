Real-Time LinkedIn Job Post Streaming

Overview
This project enables real-time streaming of LinkedIn job postings to Kafka, where the data is processed and stored in the cloud. By utilizing various AWS services, this application showcases the power of real-time data processing, cloud storage, and advanced data visualization.

Key Features
Real-Time Data Streaming: Job postings are streamed in real-time from LinkedIn to Kafka, allowing immediate access to the latest job listings.
Cloud Storage: Data is stored securely in Amazon S3, ensuring durability and accessibility.
Data Processing: AWS Glue is used to transform and prepare data for analysis.
Querying and Analysis: Amazon Athena allows for querying the stored data using standard SQL, making it easy to analyze job posting trends.
Data Visualization: Amazon QuickSight provides powerful visualization tools to gain insights from job posting data, enabling data-driven decision-making.
Technologies Used
Apache Kafka: For real-time data streaming and messaging.
AWS S3: For scalable and secure storage of job postings.
AWS Glue: For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to clean and prepare data.
Amazon Athena: For serverless SQL querying of S3 data.
Amazon QuickSight: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Python: For writing the crawler and Kafka producer/consumer applications.
Jupyter Notebooks: For data exploration and analysis.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

Data Crawler: Collects job postings from LinkedIn.
Kafka Producer: Streams job data to a Kafka topic.
Kafka Consumer: Consumes data from the Kafka topic and processes it for storage in S3.
AWS Glue: Manages ETL jobs to prepare data for analysis.
Amazon Athena: Queries the data stored in S3.
Amazon QuickSight: Visualizes the queried data for insights.
